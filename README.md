# yew-webtransport

## Summary

WebTransport is a new web standard that aims to provide a low-level API for secure, multiplexed communication between web browsers and servers. It has the potential to greatly improve the performance of web applications, especially those that require real-time communication or large data transfers. However, the current implementation of WebTransport in browsers is written in Javascript, which can make it difficult to use in Rust webapps.

## Demo

you can find a demo in the examples folder which is a port of the https://webtransport.day/ website to rust.

The website is live at https://security-union.github.io/yew-webtransport/
